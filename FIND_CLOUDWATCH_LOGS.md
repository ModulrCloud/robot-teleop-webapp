# How to Find CloudWatch Logs - Step by Step

## Issue: No Log Groups Showing

This usually means one of two things:
1. **Wrong AWS Region** (most common)
2. **Lambda function hasn't been invoked yet** (log groups created on first invocation)

## Step 1: Check Your Region

Your sandbox is deployed to **us-east-1 (N. Virginia)**, but you might be viewing **us-east-2 (Ohio)**.

### Fix: Switch to Correct Region

1. In CloudWatch Console, look at the top-right corner
2. Click the region dropdown (currently shows "United States (Ohio)")
3. Select **"US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1"**
4. Then go back to "Log groups" and search again

## Step 2: Verify Sandbox is Running

Make sure your Amplify sandbox is actually running:

```bash
# Check if sandbox is running
# You should see output from: npx ampx sandbox
```

If not running, start it:
```bash
npx ampx sandbox
```

## Step 3: Find Log Groups

After switching to **us-east-1**, search for:

1. **Search term:** `signaling`
   - Look for: `/aws/lambda/amplify-robotteleop-{identifier}-sandbox-{hash}-signaling`

2. **Or search for:** `amplify-robotteleop`
   - This will show all Lambda functions from your sandbox

## Step 4: Alternative - Find via Lambda Console

If you still can't find logs:

1. Go to **AWS Lambda Console**: https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda
2. **Make sure you're in us-east-1 region** (top-right dropdown)
3. Search for functions with "signaling" in the name
4. Click on the function
5. Click **"Monitor"** tab
6. Click **"View CloudWatch logs"** - this takes you directly to the log group

## Step 5: Trigger a Connection to Create Logs

If the log group doesn't exist yet, it will be created when the Lambda is first invoked:

1. Try connecting your robot (this will trigger the Lambda)
2. Or manually test the WebSocket connection
3. Then check CloudWatch again - the log group should appear

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] Region is set to **us-east-1 (N. Virginia)**
- [ ] Sandbox is running (`npx ampx sandbox`)
- [ ] Searched for "signaling" in log groups
- [ ] Tried connecting robot to trigger Lambda invocation
- [ ] Checked Lambda console to verify function exists

## What the Log Group Name Looks Like

```
/aws/lambda/amplify-robotteleop-undch-sandbox-f8f2d3ff18-signaling-{hash}
```

The exact name depends on:
- Your sandbox identifier (e.g., "undch")
- The hash generated by Amplify
